                Finding the available parts for your PC is usually one of 
                the first steps you should take so that you can make sure that you have
                all the necessary parts before you begin. The tool that we recommend and will 
                be talking about in this guide is a website called <a href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a>

            <h3>What is PC Part Picker</h3>

            <p id = "aboutppp">
                PC Part Picker is a website that is designed to help you pick and choose
                the components you want in order to build your PC. It has a helpful builder
                section to assist you in picking your parts, a published builds section to
                gain inspiration from other people's builds, and a section for you to browse parts such as sepecific 
                CPUs or GPUS or motherboards.

                <p>
                    The cool part about PC Part Picker is that the builder section comes 
                    with helpful tools such as compatability checker, a section that lets
                    you select from the catalog for each of the primary parts, (which you can see in the parts detail),
                    it automatically adds up the price of each of your components so that you can see a total
                    at the bottom, it shows you the estimated wattage that the machine will consume, and it also lets you add secondary components such as 
                    keyboards, mice, monitors, and operating systems. If you create an account on the website,
                    you can even publish and save your custom parts lists.
