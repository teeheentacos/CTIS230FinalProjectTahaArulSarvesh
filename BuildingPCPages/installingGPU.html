          <h1 style="text-align:center">Installing the GPU</h1>
          <p>Before we even think about mounting the GPU we have to make space for it. Most cases have removable slots next to the motherboard's PCIE ports(where the GPU plugs into). Line up your GPU with the PCIE port you want to mount it into and figure out how many
              slots in the case you have to remove. Loosen the screws holding those slots but don't put them away because we will need it for later. Once the appropriate amount of slots have been removed the GPU can be mounted.
            </p>
            <img id = "GPUSlots" src="../BuildingPCPages/imagesBuilding/gpuimage1.jpg" alt = "Removing the rear case slots" class="center">
            <p>Installing the GPU is very similar to installing the RAM. There is a notch on the bottom of the GPU that will match with a notch in the PCIE port as well as a plastic lock on the side of the port. Match the GPU so it will fit into the port correctly and push down until the plastic
                lock closes just as it would with a stick of RAM. Lastly, tighten the GPU to the case using the screws you originally removed.</p>
