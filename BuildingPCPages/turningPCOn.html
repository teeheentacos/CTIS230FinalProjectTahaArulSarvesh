            <h2>Turning on the PC</h2>
            <p>After your PC is built the very first thing we have to do is plug it in. Plug the power cable from a wall outlet to the PC, plug in the monitor, mouse, and keyboard you will use, adn plug in any additional cables like ethernet. Once that is all
                plugged in, switch the PSU on, and then press the power button on your PC case. This should turn it on and you should see some fan movement and lights if you have them, if so congratulations! You have built a working PC.
            </p>
            <h2>BIOS Check</h2>
            <p>On the first boot up of your PC, you should be directed to a screen with information on hwo to enter the UEFI or BIOS which is a program installed on your motherboard that allows you to diagnose your PC. Navigate your BIOS until you find information
                regarding the devices your PC detects. Ensuree that the correct CPU, GPU, RAM and RAM slots, and storage drives are listed. If you want a certain preformance from your PC or to overclock some parts this is where you would do it, but for now let's focus on 
                finishing the setup.
            </p>
            <h2>Installing an OS</h2>
            <p>This guide will cover how to install Windows 10 but the process is the same for any other OS you may want to use. In order to get Windows 10 onto your PC it will have to download it off a USB since it does not have an OS to acess the internet yet.
                Go to <a href ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" id="windowslink">this webpage</a> to download Windows 10. Run the installer and select the option to download Windows 10 to an installation media and dowload it onto a USB. Plug this USB
                into your new PC and then boot it up and it should automatically start setting up Windows. From there just follow the instructions on screen and your PC is ready for use!
