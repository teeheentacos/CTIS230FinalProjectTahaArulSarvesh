          <h1 style="text-align:center">Installing M.2 Storage</h1>
          <p>NOTE: This step is optional if you do not have a M.2 storage drive</p>
          <p>First find the M.2 connection on your motherboard. More recent motherboards usually cover this section with a removable part that you would have to unscrew. Consult the motherboard's manual to ensure you have located the M.2 connection.
            Assuming you have done your due diligence and bought compatible parts, the M.2 storage will fit easily into the connection slot and once connected should tilt upwards and point in the air. Then press down on the M.2 drive until it is parallel to the motherboard
            and resting on the mounting screw on the motherboard. The M.2 drive should have came with additional screws to tighten the drive to the motherboard. This will keep it in place and the drive should not be tilting towards the air anymore.
