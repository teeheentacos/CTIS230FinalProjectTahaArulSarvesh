                RGB is an abbreviation of Red, Green, and Blue. RGB lighting is a bunch
                of LEDs chained up together and they can normally be controlled by built-in 
                settings on the motherboard or they can also be controlled by a separate controller.

                <p>
                    RGB lighting can be found in many different forms, some cases
                    come with them built in, you can buy RGB strips to stick around the case, 
                    RGB also comes in fans, GPUs, RAM sticks, on the actual motherboard, and you can 
                    even get it on water coolers. Adding these RGB elements won't increase your energy usage/wattage, 
                    but it will increase the cost of the components quite a bit.
