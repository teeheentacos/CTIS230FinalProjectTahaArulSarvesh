            <h2>Accessories</h2>

            <p id = "accessoriesintro">
                There are a multitude of accessories you can buy and add to your PC set up 
                for your use cases. If you are a gamer, then you might buy a nice keyboard and mouse 
                and maybe a gaming headset and a mic. If you like to produce music, then you might get 
                a MIDI keyboard and a studio mic and headset. Or, if you are a drawer, then you could 
                get a drawing tablet such as a Wacom or a large screen monitor.

                <p>
                    The possibilities for accessories are endless, but as far as just the keyboards and mice go 
                    there are different types. For example, you can either get a membrane keyboard, a touch keyboard, or a 
                    mechanical keyboard. The only difference between these is how they feel when typing and whichever one you choose 
                    will be totally a personal preference. Mice, on the other hand are quite important in the different types. 
                    There are optical mice, ball mice, and laser mice, just to name a few. Optical mice are the most general and 
                    basic type of mice that you will find and they are good for normal day to day tasks. However, they are not 
                    as accurate as laser mice. Laser mice are of course more accurate than the other two and are preferred for gaming due 
                    to the high accuracy. ball based mice are the least accurate and are generally not used often. You can 
                    also choose mice based on other use cases such as the Magic Mouse, it you use a Mac, or a vertical mouse 
                    if you want an ergonomic design, or even mouse specifically designed for gaming with higher accuracy, lower latency, 
                    customizable buttons and DPI. These are just the options for the keyboard and mouse, but there are many 
                    options for other types of accessories from audio DACs to studio quality mics.
