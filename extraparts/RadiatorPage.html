                A radiator is used in water cooling. You run water through a cooling block over the 
                CPU or GPU, then it goes through a radiator where it pushes out the heat by air that is 
                blown through the radiator by fans.

                <p>
                    If you use air cooling, then you don't need a radiator. If you use a liquid
                    cooling kit, the radiator will be part of that kit so you still don't need a 
                    radiator in this case. If you build a custom water cooling loop then you would
                    have to buy a radiator and install it. There are different size radiators and 
                    different materials used to build radiators. The larger the radiator, the more components 
                    you will be able to cool. The materials you can use are brass-copper, aluminum, and full copper. 
                    These don't really have much impact on the cooling performance, but choosing copper will reduce corrosion 
                    over time.
