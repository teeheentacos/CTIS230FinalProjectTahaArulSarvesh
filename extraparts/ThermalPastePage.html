            <h2>Thermal Paste</h2>

            <p id = "thermalpasteintro">
                Thermal paste is a thermally conductive chemical compound, which is 
                commonly used between heat sinks and heat sources such as CPUs and GPUs. 
                The main role of thermal paste is to eliminate air gaps from the area to 
                maximize heat dissipation, making the cooling system more efficient.

                <p>
                    Some CPUs and heat sinks or coolers may come with thermal paste preapplied or 
                    with a bottle of thermal paste. But most of the time, with custom built and pre-built 
                    PCs, it is beneficial to remove preapplied paste and apply store bought brands, since manufacturers
                    may cheap out on factory applied paste. The highest quality thermal pastes are from reputable
                    brands such as Artic Silver or Noctua.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not all thermal pastes are the same, however, they can be made up of many different
                    ingredients. There are metal based compounds, ceramic based compounds, and silicone based compounds.
                    These are important to consider because each different type has different properties
                    such as thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, and conductivity. The optimal levels of
                    each of these properties will depend on your use case. For example, a PC built
                    for gaming would be better performing if a metal based thermal compund was used because 
                    metal has much better conductivity.
